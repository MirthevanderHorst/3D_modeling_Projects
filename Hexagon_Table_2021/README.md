# Hexagon Table Digital 3D Model

Before making this table using real wood, the customer wanted to see what it would look like once finished. To give a realistic impression, I drew the table using CAD-software Vectorworks and used Fusion360 to render it.
Making the digital model also allowed for it to be 3D-printed, pointing out weaknesses in the design. 

Technical drawings were also made using Vectorworks. These drawings where mostly meant for myself, so I did not spend too much time making them, but they definetly show what I am capable of!

When making this 3D model, I did not intent to use it in my portfolio. After graduating college I lost access to Vectorworks and Fusion360, meaning I sadly can not open many of the files anymore.
The only files I managed to retrieve (so far) were some rendered images and the simplified model used for 3D printing. Hopefully it will still give you a good impression of how I design models in 3D!
