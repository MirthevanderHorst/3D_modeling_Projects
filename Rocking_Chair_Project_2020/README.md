# 'Waggle' Rocking Chair Project

This was my first ever Vectorworks project. The goal of this project was to design a product using only a 122x244cm sheet of plywood, leaving close to 0 zero waste.
To achieve this I decided to use a CNC machine, resulting in me digitally designing the product first. 
I did not want it to be very complicated woodworking (it was still very early in my education), so designing the product as some sort of 'puzzle' seemed the logical choice.

To make it slightly more challenging for myself to fully use the plywood, round shapes were used. This resulted in me making several smaller products, rather than 1 big one. 
Vectorworks was used throughout the whole project. To experiment with what the possibilities are with software like this, I designed/drew a few showrooms that contained several of the project pieces. 

Apart from 2 .stl files (you can find them in this repo), the original files to this project sadly got lost.

Fun fact: The step stool and rocking chairs still get used almost daily, they are surprisingly comfortable! Check out pictures of it in my 'Woodworking_Projects' repository.
