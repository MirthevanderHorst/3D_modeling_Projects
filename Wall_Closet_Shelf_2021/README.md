# Wall Closet Shelf

This was the very first thing I made using Fusion360. I already made the actual product at that point, but wanted to see how realistic the render would be. The textures definetely surprised me!
For this project I sadly do not have the original files anymore.

The technical drawings where mostly meant as practice for myself and to reflect on how I made the product.
